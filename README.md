# AgUse
Here is the ag use Python script that generates a separate map for each PIN in a geodatabase table. Currently, it works great until it gets into the 130s, then it errors out when it tries to export the map to a JPEG. (The function is after the JPG EXPORT comment, called arcpy.mapping.ExporttoJPEG) The first time I ran it, I got about 140 maps before the script stopped working, but subsequent re-runs have only gotten into the mid 130s before crashing. Maybe there is a limit to the ExporttoJPEG function? Anyway, I appreciate any suggestions. - Amy
