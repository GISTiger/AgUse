# AgUse
I'm just getting started on GitHub. My goal for today is to post two Python scripts with which I've been tinkering over the past month. I'm sure there are ways to improve them, since I am also a beginner at Python. I appreciate suggestions, even if I don't end up using them! My hope is that I'll learn more by sharing this code, and possibly work out some minor bugs in the process.
